Please create a single-page responsive portfolio website showcasing your understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and particularly Bootstrap.

Requirements
Header Section: Your portfolio should start with a header containing a navigation bar with links to the different sections of your page. It should include your name and a brief tagline.

About Me Section: This section should briefly describe yourself, your skills, and your journey towards web development.

Projects Section: This section should display a list of your projects. Each project should have a title, a short description, the technologies used, and optionally, a link to the project or GitHub repository. 

Contact Me Section: This section should provide your professional contact information and links to your LinkedIn, GitHub, and other relevant profiles. It should also include a contact form (frontend only) where visitors can leave a message.

Responsiveness: Your portfolio should be fully responsive and display well on all device sizes.

Bootstrap: Utilize Bootstrap components and utilities wherever possible. For instance, employ the grid system for content layout, nav for navigation, cards for projects, and forms for the contact section.

Optional Feature: Include a "Back to Top" button that appears when the user scrolls down the page. Implement smooth scrolling using JavaScript and Bootstrap's Scrollspy component to update the active link in the navigation bar.
